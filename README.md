# LavaLampTeamCity

This is a hobby project implementation of "extreme feedback" application used for
visual tracking of build status of defined build jobs configured on TemCity server.
For each defined build job there is one glass tube which can be set in three states:
success (green liquid with few bubbles), running (yellow liquid with more bubbles)
and failed (red liquid with boiling bubbles). It is written in Qt/Qml.
